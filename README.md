Digital Anvil is a videogame review website that provides users with reviews and once logged into the site, it allows users to post their own reviews so to add to our database. In doing this, Digital Anvil is there to help consumers make an informed decision on how to spend their time and money on their videogame entertainment. The site features dynamically updated HTML and CSS with a SQL backend database for users to add and search for relevant data.
